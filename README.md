# Well, Hello There (my attempt to imitate the great Obi-Wan here), I'm Gio. Nice to see you. 
Welcome to my Github. 

- 🔭 I'm a Junior Software Engineer at Cognizant, UK with a primary focus on front end technologies. 
- 👨‍🎓 I graduated from Makers Academy, a highly selective bootcamp in London. 
- 💖 Passionate about React, Redux and MERN-associated technologies. 
- 📍 Based in London, UK 🇬🇧
- 🌶 I am innately a curious person and love learning new libraries & technologies.
- 👀 In my spare time, I strive to find my next favourite cheese, the smellier the better! 
- ✨ My work ethic summarized in one quote: 
> Before enlightenment chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.\
> – Zen saying
